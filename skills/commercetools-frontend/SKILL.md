  Storefront development patterns for commercetools from Aries Solutions
  Engineering. Use when building headless storefronts with Next.js or React,
  implementing commercetools Frontend (Studio, components, extensions, data
  sources, actions), creating product listing pages (PLP), product detail pages
  (PDP), cart UI, checkout flows, or integrating commercetools Checkout. Triggers
  on tasks involving storefront, frontend, Next.js, React, SSR, SSG, ISR, Server
  Components, App Router, commercetools Frontend, Studio, tastics, extensions,
  data sources, actions, PDP, PLP, category pages, cart UI, checkout UI,
  headless commerce, GraphQL frontend, product search UI, SEO, Core Web Vitals,
  performance, image optimization, i18n, locale routing, structured data,
  sitemap, B2B storefront. MUST be consulted before building storefront pages
  or integrating commercetools data into a frontend application. Do NOT use
  for backend API code, data modeling, or Merchant Center UI.

# commercetools Frontend & Storefront Development

## Two Development Paths

This skill covers **two distinct approaches** to building storefronts on commercetools:

| Approach | When to Use | Key File |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **commercetools Frontend** (hosted) | Using Studio for business users, extensions, components (tastics), data sources | [references/ct-frontend-extensions.md](references/ct-frontend-extensions.md) |
| **Headless with Next.js/React** | Custom storefront with full control, App Router, Server Components | [references/storefront-architecture.md](references/storefront-architecture.md) |
| **B2B Storefront** | Business units, permissions, approval workflows, quotes, purchase lists | [references/b2b-frontend.md](references/b2b-frontend.md) |

Both approaches share patterns for product pages, cart/checkout UI, and performance/SEO. B2B patterns layer on top of either approach.

## How to Use This Skill

1. Identify which approach you are using (commercetools Frontend or headless Next.js)
2. Load the relevant architecture file first
3. Then load the page-type-specific reference for your current task
4. Reference files contain correct/incorrect code pairs, checklists, and pitfall warnings

**Progressive loading -- only load what you need:**

- Using commercetools Frontend extensions, data sources, actions? Load `references/ct-frontend-extensions.md`
- Using commercetools Frontend components, Studio, renderer? Load `references/ct-frontend-components.md`
- Building a headless Next.js storefront? Load `references/storefront-architecture.md`
- Building product listing pages (PLP, filtering, pagination)? Load `references/product-listing-pages.md`
- Building product detail pages (PDP, variants, product cards)? Load `references/product-detail-pages.md`
- Building cart UI? Load `references/cart-ui.md`
- Building checkout flows? Load `references/checkout-ui.md`
- Optimizing frontend performance (images, LCP, code splitting)? Load `references/frontend-performance.md`
- Optimizing SEO (structured data, meta tags, sitemap)? Load `references/frontend-seo.md`
- Building a B2B storefront (business units, quotes, approvals)? Load `references/b2b-frontend.md`

## CRITICAL Priority

| Pattern | File | Impact |
|---------|------|--------|
| Data fetching strategy (SSR vs SSG vs ISR) | [references/storefront-architecture.md](references/storefront-architecture.md) | Wrong strategy causes stale prices, slow pages, or API quota exhaustion |
| Cart state management & optimistic updates | [references/cart-ui.md](references/cart-ui.md) | Race conditions cause quantity bugs, lost items, broken checkout |
| Extension timeout limits (8s max) | [references/ct-frontend-extensions.md](references/ct-frontend-extensions.md) | Slow extensions fail silently, breaking pages for all users |
| Image optimization & LCP | [references/frontend-performance.md](references/frontend-performance.md) | Unoptimized product images destroy Core Web Vitals scores |
| B2B permission-gated UI | [references/b2b-frontend.md](references/b2b-frontend.md) | Missing permission checks expose admin actions to unauthorized users |

## HIGH Priority

| Pattern | File | Impact |
|---------|------|--------|
| Server Components for product data | [references/storefront-architecture.md](references/storefront-architecture.md) | Client-side fetching leaks API credentials and doubles load time |
| PLP pagination & filtering | [references/product-listing-pages.md](references/product-listing-pages.md) | N+1 queries on listing pages cause 3-10s load times |
| Checkout flow & payment integration | [references/checkout-ui.md](references/checkout-ui.md) | Missing error states cause silent payment failures |
| Component schema design (tastics) | [references/ct-frontend-components.md](references/ct-frontend-components.md) | Bad schemas make components unusable for business users in Studio |
| SEO structured data for products | [references/frontend-seo.md](references/frontend-seo.md) | Missing structured data means no rich results in Google |
| Locale routing & currency formatting | [references/storefront-architecture.md](references/storefront-architecture.md) | Wrong i18n setup breaks prices, URLs, and search indexing |
| B2B quote lifecycle & approval flows | [references/b2b-frontend.md](references/b2b-frontend.md) | Quote cart consumption and approval rejection side effects break B2B checkout |

## MEDIUM Priority

| Pattern | File | Impact |
|---------|------|--------|
| Product variant selection UI | [references/product-detail-pages.md](references/product-detail-pages.md) | Confusing variant selectors reduce conversion |
| Faceted search UI patterns | [references/product-listing-pages.md](references/product-listing-pages.md) | Slow or broken filters frustrate shoppers |
| commercetools Checkout integration | [references/checkout-ui.md](references/checkout-ui.md) | Misconfigured Checkout SDK blocks payment completion |
| Code splitting & bundle size | [references/frontend-performance.md](references/frontend-performance.md) | Oversized bundles increase Time to Interactive |
| Data source extension patterns | [references/ct-frontend-extensions.md](references/ct-frontend-extensions.md) | Redundant API calls from multiple components on a page |
| Studio page management & publishing | [references/ct-frontend-components.md](references/ct-frontend-components.md) | Wrong page folder structure breaks dynamic routing |
| B2B business unit & store scoping | [references/b2b-frontend.md](references/b2b-frontend.md) | Missing BU/store context causes cross-tenant data leaks |
| B2B purchase lists & quick order | [references/b2b-frontend.md](references/b2b-frontend.md) | Wrong Wishlist API mapping breaks purchase list CRUD |

## Common Frontend Anti-Patterns (Quick Reference)

| Anti-Pattern | File | Consequence |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| Fetching product data client-side | [references/storefront-architecture.md](references/storefront-architecture.md) | Exposes API credentials, no SSR benefits, poor SEO |
| Using `getServerSideProps` for static catalog pages | [references/storefront-architecture.md](references/storefront-architecture.md) | Every page visit hits the API, wastes quota, slow TTFB |
| Not implementing optimistic cart updates | [references/cart-ui.md](references/cart-ui.md) | UI freezes on every add-to-cart, feels broken |
| Loading all product images at full resolution | [references/frontend-performance.md](references/frontend-performance.md) | 5-10MB page weight, failed Core Web Vitals |
| Fetching all product attributes when you need 3 | [references/product-detail-pages.md](references/product-detail-pages.md) | 5-10x response payload, slower rendering |
| Building search from scratch instead of using Product Search API | [references/product-listing-pages.md](references/product-listing-pages.md) | Poor relevance, no faceting, slow queries |
| Missing error boundaries around commerce data | [references/storefront-architecture.md](references/storefront-architecture.md) | One failed API call crashes the entire page |
| Hardcoding locale/currency instead of using routing | [references/storefront-architecture.md](references/storefront-architecture.md) | Broken multi-market support, wrong prices |

## MCP Complement

Use this skill for storefront patterns, then use the [Developer MCP](https://docs.commercetools.com/sdk/mcp/developer-mcp) to look up field names and schemas, and the [Commerce MCP](https://docs.commercetools.com/sdk/mcp/commerce-mcp) for CRUD operations.
