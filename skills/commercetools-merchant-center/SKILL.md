  commercetools Merchant Center custom application and custom view development
  patterns from Aries Solutions Engineering. Use when building MC extensions, creating
  custom applications or custom views, working with the MC SDK, Application Shell,
  ui-kit components, or deploying MC customizations. Triggers on tasks involving
  Merchant Center, custom application, custom view, MC extension, MC SDK, ui-kit,
  Application Shell, entryPointUriPath, CustomViewShell, ApplicationShell, mc-scripts,
  create-mc-app, FormModalPage, useMcQuery, useMcMutation, GRAPHQL_TARGETS,
  merchant-center-application-kit, MC deployment, MC permissions, or OAuth scopes.
  MUST be consulted before scaffolding a new MC customization or choosing between
  Custom Application and Custom View. Do NOT use for backend API code, data
  modeling, or storefront pages.

# commercetools Merchant Center Customization Development

**Progressive loading — only load what you need:**

- Building a Custom Application? Load `references/custom-applications.md`
- Building a Custom View? Load `references/custom-views.md`
- Working with data fetching or external API proxying? Load `references/ui-data-fetching.md`
- Working with forms, routing, or UI Kit components? Load `references/ui-forms-components.md`
- Deploying or testing? Load `references/deployment.md`

## CRITICAL Priority -- Architectural Decisions

| Pattern | File | Impact |
|---------|------|--------|
| Custom Application vs Custom View | [references/custom-applications.md](references/custom-applications.md) | Wrong choice means rebuilding from scratch. Applications are full pages; Views are embedded panels. |
| Application Shell & Entry Point Config | [references/custom-applications.md](references/custom-applications.md) | Misconfigured `entryPointUriPath` or `cloudIdentifier` blocks all development. Reserved paths silently fail. |
| OAuth Scopes & Permission Model | [references/custom-applications.md](references/custom-applications.md) | Missing scopes cause 403 errors in production. Over-scoping violates least privilege. Team assignment is required. |

## HIGH Priority -- Development Patterns

| Pattern | File | Impact |
|---------|------|--------|
| Custom View Panel Types & Locators | [references/custom-views.md](references/custom-views.md) | Wrong panel size or locator means content does not display where users expect it. |
| Data Fetching with useMcQuery | [references/ui-data-fetching.md](references/ui-data-fetching.md) | Using raw Apollo without MC context breaks authentication. Must use `GRAPHQL_TARGETS`. |
| Forward-To Proxy for External APIs | [references/ui-data-fetching.md](references/ui-data-fetching.md) | Custom API integration requires `/proxy/forward-to` with JWT validation. Direct calls from the browser fail. |
| Form Patterns with Formik | [references/ui-forms-components.md](references/ui-forms-components.md) | MC SDK fields expect Formik integration. Raw form state causes validation and accessibility gaps. |
| Routing & Navigation | [references/ui-forms-components.md](references/ui-forms-components.md) | Must use `useRouteMatch` for nested routes. Hardcoded paths break across projects. |
| UI Kit Components & Design System | [references/ui-forms-components.md](references/ui-forms-components.md) | Ignoring ui-kit produces inconsistent UX and fails design review. |

## MEDIUM Priority -- Deployment & Operations

| Pattern | File | Impact |
|---------|------|--------|
| Deployment to Vercel / Netlify | [references/deployment.md](references/deployment.md) | Missing SPA rewrites cause 404s. Wrong build command skips MC compilation. |
| Deployment to commercetools Connect | [references/deployment.md](references/deployment.md) | connect.yaml misconfiguration blocks deployment. APPLICATION_URL is auto-provided. |
| Application Registration & States | [references/deployment.md](references/deployment.md) | Forgetting to move from Draft to Ready means the app cannot be installed. |
| Testing Custom Applications | [references/deployment.md](references/deployment.md) | MC-specific test utilities required for permission and context mocking. |

## Common Anti-Patterns (Quick Reference)

| Anti-Pattern | File | Consequence |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| Using raw Apollo instead of useMcQuery | [references/ui-data-fetching.md](references/ui-data-fetching.md) | Breaks MC authentication context |
| Calling external APIs directly from browser | [references/ui-data-fetching.md](references/ui-data-fetching.md) | CORS failures, bypassed auth -- use Forward-To proxy |
| Using raw React state instead of Formik | [references/ui-forms-components.md](references/ui-forms-components.md) | Validation and accessibility gaps with MC fields |
| Using ApplicationShell in a Custom View | [references/custom-views.md](references/custom-views.md) | Wrong shell -- Custom Views require CustomViewShell |
| Reserved or hardcoded entryPointUriPath | [references/custom-applications.md](references/custom-applications.md) | Application silently fails to load |
| Forgetting Draft-to-Ready state transition | [references/deployment.md](references/deployment.md) | App appears registered but cannot be installed |

## Decision Flowchart: Custom Application or Custom View?

```
Does the functionality need its own page and main menu entry?
  YES --> Custom Application
  NO  --> Continue

Does the functionality enhance an EXISTING built-in MC page?
  (e.g., extra details on an Order, Customer, or Product page)
  YES --> Custom View
  NO  --> Continue

Does the functionality require complex multi-page navigation?
  (e.g., list page, detail page, create/edit forms)
  YES --> Custom Application
  NO  --> Continue

Is the functionality a simple panel showing contextual info or actions?
  (e.g., order tracking, loyalty points, quick edits)
  YES --> Custom View (narrow or extended panel)
  NO  --> Custom Application (default choice for standalone features)
```

## MCP Complement

Use this skill to DESIGN and STRUCTURE your MC extension, then use the [Developer MCP](https://docs.commercetools.com/sdk/mcp/developer-mcp) for MC SDK docs and the [Commerce MCP](https://docs.commercetools.com/sdk/mcp/commerce-mcp) for CRUD operations.
