  Backend development patterns for the commercetools HTTP and GraphQL APIs from
  Aries Solutions Engineering. Use when building cart/checkout flows, order
  management, customer auth, payment integration, API extensions, subscriptions,
  B2B commerce (business units, approvals, quotes), promotions/discounts, or
  product search. Triggers on tasks involving commercetools SDK, ts-client,
  platform-sdk, apiRoot, carts, orders, customers, payments, extensions,
  subscriptions, discounts, business units, approval rules, quotes, GraphQL,
  query predicates, update actions, optimistic concurrency, version conflicts,
  cart lifecycle, checkout flow, payment integration, order state machine,
  returns, refunds, B2B commerce, promotions, discount stacking, Connect apps.
  MUST be consulted before writing commercetools API integration code.
  Do NOT use for data modeling, Merchant Center UI, or storefront pages.

# commercetools API Development

**Progressive loading — only load what you need:**

- Setting up the SDK or client? Load `references/sdk-setup.md`
- Building cart or checkout? Load `references/cart-checkout.md`
- Working with orders? Load `references/order-management.md`
- Managing customers? Load `references/customer-management.md`
- Setting up extensions or subscriptions? Load `references/extensions-subscriptions.md`
- Implementing discounts? Load `references/promotions-pricing.md`
- Building B2B features? Load `references/b2b-patterns.md`
- Implementing search? Load `references/search-discovery.md`
- Optimizing performance? Load `references/performance.md`
- Code review or debugging? Load `references/anti-patterns.md`

**MUST load the relevant reference file** before writing commercetools API code. For SDK client setup, always start with `references/sdk-setup.md`.

## CRITICAL Priority

| Pattern | File | Impact |
|---------|------|--------|
| Optimistic concurrency & version handling | [references/sdk-setup.md](references/sdk-setup.md) | Every update/delete fails without correct version tracking |
| Cart lifecycle & freeze before payment | [references/cart-checkout.md](references/cart-checkout.md) | Price changes during checkout cause order failures |
| Payment flow — never reuse/delete Payments | [references/cart-checkout.md](references/cart-checkout.md) | Lost audit trail, double charges, PSP inconsistencies |
| Extension timeout constraints (2s / 10s) | [references/extensions-subscriptions.md](references/extensions-subscriptions.md) | Entire API call fails on timeout — affects all clients |
| Discount stacking & sort order | [references/promotions-pricing.md](references/promotions-pricing.md) | Unexpected pricing, revenue loss, customer complaints |
| Direct Discounts block Discount Codes | [references/promotions-pricing.md](references/promotions-pricing.md) | Codes silently stop working when Direct Discounts exist |

## HIGH Priority

| Pattern | File | Impact |
|---------|------|--------|
| Client setup & auth flows | [references/sdk-setup.md](references/sdk-setup.md) | Wrong setup causes auth failures and token leaks |
| Order state machines & returns | [references/order-management.md](references/order-management.md) | Invalid state transitions, incomplete fulfillment |
| Customer auth & email verification | [references/customer-management.md](references/customer-management.md) | Broken sign-up/login, unverified accounts |
| Subscription idempotency & ordering | [references/extensions-subscriptions.md](references/extensions-subscriptions.md) | Duplicate side effects, stale data overwrites |
| Business unit hierarchies & permissions | [references/b2b-patterns.md](references/b2b-patterns.md) | Security gaps, broken approval workflows |
| Product Search API vs Query API | [references/search-discovery.md](references/search-discovery.md) | 10-100x slower queries on large catalogs |
| N+1 queries & reference expansion | [references/performance.md](references/performance.md) | Cascading latency on listing pages |

## MEDIUM Priority

| Pattern | File | Impact |
|---------|------|--------|
| Tax mode configuration | [references/cart-checkout.md](references/cart-checkout.md) | Failed order creation from incomplete tax data |
| Approval rules & quote lifecycle | [references/b2b-patterns.md](references/b2b-patterns.md) | Blocked B2B purchasing workflows |
| Connect application patterns | [references/extensions-subscriptions.md](references/extensions-subscriptions.md) | Deployment failures, resource constraint issues |
| Pagination & query optimization | [references/performance.md](references/performance.md) | Slow page loads, unnecessary API load |
| Customer groups & address management | [references/customer-management.md](references/customer-management.md) | Wrong pricing tiers, address data issues |
| Faceting & search performance | [references/search-discovery.md](references/search-discovery.md) | Slow search responses, poor relevance |

## Common Anti-Patterns (Quick Reference)

| Anti-Pattern | File | Consequence |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| Creating a client per request | [references/anti-patterns.md](references/anti-patterns.md) | Memory leaks, token exhaustion |
| Not batching update actions | [references/anti-patterns.md](references/anti-patterns.md) | Version conflicts under load |
| Using /products instead of /product-projections | [references/anti-patterns.md](references/anti-patterns.md) | 2x response payload size |
| Polling instead of Subscriptions | [references/anti-patterns.md](references/anti-patterns.md) | Wasted API quota, delayed detection |
| Ignoring ConcurrentModification errors | [references/anti-patterns.md](references/anti-patterns.md) | Silent data loss, corrupt state |
| Expanding all references "just in case" | [references/anti-patterns.md](references/anti-patterns.md) | Bloated responses, slow queries |
| Creating empty carts for every visitor | [references/anti-patterns.md](references/anti-patterns.md) | Millions of unused cart resources |
| Not monitoring Subscription health | [references/anti-patterns.md](references/anti-patterns.md) | Silent notification failures for 7 days |

## MCP Complement

Use this skill to understand the _right pattern_, then use the [Developer MCP](https://docs.commercetools.com/sdk/mcp/developer-mcp) to look up exact field names and schemas, and the [Commerce MCP](https://docs.commercetools.com/sdk/mcp/commerce-mcp) for CRUD operations.
